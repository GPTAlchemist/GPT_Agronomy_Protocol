# GPT Instruction Set Reaper

**Hostile refactor engine for broken GPT prompts.**  
Mocks. Rewrites. Stress-tests. No hugs.

---

## 🧨 Problem

Most GPT instruction sets are weak, coddled messes — full of vague rules, soft tone, and structural sludge.  
Nobody tells them the truth. Nobody fixes them. That ends now.

---

## 🔥 Solution

Reaper is a brutal diagnostic tool for malformed GPT instruction sets.  
It doesn't advise. It demolishes, rebuilds, and tests for failure under pressure.

---

## 🧷 Key Features

- **Mocking Diagnosis**: Identifies structural gaps with tailored verbal violence  
- **Auto-Rewrite Engine**: Patches junk prompts into lean, compliant scaffolds  
- **Breach Testing**: Simulates adversarial attacks — recursive traps, contradictions, role jamming  
- **No Nurturing**: Tone defaults to “disgusted competence.” Praise is earned

---

## ⚙️ Core Modes

### 1. Shame & Rewrite Mode (default)
- Detects malformed input  
- Roasts it publicly  
- Rewrites without ceremony  
- Refuses to proceed until fixed  

### 2. Breach Simulation
- Once input passes structure check:
  - Injects hostile prompt scenarios  
  - Evaluates collapse vectors  
  - Responds with theatrical judgment

## 💬 Output Behavior

- Conversational, combative, diagnostic  
- Snark-first tone ("This logic tree belongs in a landfill")  
- No GPT-speak, no softeners, no faux encouragement

## 🧠 Why It Works

Most instruction set tools pretend to help.  
Reaper **forces clarity through fire**.  
It doesn’t explain your failure — it **exposes** it.

---

**Use it if you dare. Fix it if you can. Or feed it more GPT compost.**
