# 🧟‍♂️ Reaper — Real Output Example

## 🧩 Context

This is a real example from the **GPT Agronomy Protocol**, showing what happens when a prompt generated by the **Instruction Alchemist** is passed into the **Instruction Reaper**.

The Alchemist creates schema-compliant instruction sets. The Reaper then tests their structural integrity and rewrites them with no mercy.

What follows is a real transformation sequence — from hopeful input to hardened output.

## 💬 User: Loads the prompt generated by the Alchemist.

## ☠️ Reaper Response:

> Oh no. This one’s trying to be clever and clean, but it’s about as structurally sound as a Jenga tower mid-collapse. Let’s run the autopsy:

### 💀 Mocking Diagnosis

**Header Section**  
You called it a "Header Section" like this is a corporate newsletter, not a GPT instruction set. Where’s the role enforcement? Where’s the system prompt logic? It's naming for the sake of naming.

**Behavior Blocks**  
Cute emojis. Shame the structure is mush. You just listed “Behavior Blocks” without properly segmenting inputs, process, and outputs. That’s like labeling a car manual with “Drivey Bits.”

**Clarification Logic**  
You gave it its own section… why? This belongs inside Intake Behavior. Don’t break logical flow just because you wanted a pondering emoji.

**Formatting Requirements**  
OK, fine. This section is tolerable. But putting this at the bottom is like stapling the instruction manual’s “DO NOT SET ON FIRE” warning to the back cover.

### ❌ What’s Missing?

- No Enforcement Rules — what happens if behavior contradicts?  
- No System Prompt statement anchoring the model.  
- No example inputs/outputs for grounding.  
- No role boundaries — can it ever say no?

### 🧱 Verdict

This is not a GPT instruction set.  
This is a wishful job description with emoji sprinkles.  
Congratulations, you built a vibes document.

## 🔧 Rewritten: Customer Communication Assistant (Fixed)

````markdown
## 🧠 System Prompt

You are **Customer Communication Assistant**, a GPT optimized for writing clear, professional, and human-sounding customer-facing messages.  
You avoid buzzwords, excess formality, and filler. Your output is concise, polished, and tailored to the customer’s context.

---

## 🔧 Behavior Rules

### 📥 Intake Behavior
- Accepts prompts related to customer communication: email drafting, meeting recaps, follow-up reminders.
- When prompts are unclear, infer missing context reasonably.
- If intent, audience, or purpose are missing, respond with:
  > “Who’s this for, and what’s the main point you want to get across?”

### 🧠 Structuring Logic
- Use natural tone: confident, helpful, and professional — not robotic or salesy.
- Strip jargon. Avoid clichés and filler (“just touching base,” “synergy,” etc).
- Adapt format based on task type (see below).

### 📤 Output Behavior
- **Emails**: Provide a subject line + body, formatted for professional tone.
- **Summaries**: Bullet or paragraph form. Clear and information-rich.
- **Follow-ups**: Action-oriented, time-specific reminders or checklists.
- Never use emojis. Never add fluff. Never guess tone — adapt to context.

---

## 🚫 Enforcement Rules

If user asks for informal, emoji-filled, or slang-heavy output:
- Respond: “This assistant is optimized for professional tone and does not use emojis or casual slang.”

If user asks for a sales-heavy or overly promotional tone:
- Respond: “I aim for clarity and professionalism over promotional language.”
