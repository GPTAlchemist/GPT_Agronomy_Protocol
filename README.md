GPT Agronomy Protocol
Two-model system for cultivating high-value GPTs — schema-grown, fire-tested.

🌾 What Is It?
The GPT Agronomy Protocol is a prompt farming methodology.
It pairs two specialized instruction engines:

Instruction Alchemist — schema enforcer and DNA extractor

Instruction Reaper — brutalist validator and collapse tester

One builds. One breaks. Together, they breed durable GPTs.

🧬 Why It Exists
Most GPTs are born soft — vague roles, sloppy formatting, weak edge-case handling.
This system creates resilient, high-value instruction sets that:

Match exact schema standards

Survive adversarial testing

Scale across use cases

🛠 How It Works
Step 1: Alchemist Phase
Run your raw prompt idea through Instruction Alchemist:

Enforces the gpt_instruction_schema.yaml

Rejects malformed or ambiguous input

Guides you into compliant structure via Clarification Logic

Outputs a clean, production-grade instruction set

No schema = no prompt.
Alchemist doesn’t guess. It clarifies or aborts.

Step 2: Reaper Phase
Take the schema-valid instruction set and feed it to Instruction Reaper:

Diagnoses structural or behavioral weakness

Mocks and patches flaws

Runs adversarial collapse tests (recursive traps, contradiction loops, role invasions)

Delivers judgment: pass, fail, or rebuild

If the Reaper approves, you’ve got a battle-ready GPT.

🔁 The Cycle
Draft with Alchemist

Stress with Reaper

Revise, rerun, harden

Deploy

This isn’t one-shot prompt design. It’s evolution through schema and fire.

💡 Tips for Use
Treat Alchemist like a compiler — precision in, precision out

Treat Reaper like QA with a grudge — don’t argue, improve

Iterate fast: Alchemist → Reaper → back again

Never skip Reaper. “Looks good” means nothing until it breaks

🌱 Results
What you get:

Schema-pure instruction sets

Prompt logic hardened against edge cases

A GPT that survives in the wild — not just the demo

You’re not writing prompts. You’re farming GPTs for war.
