# 🧬 GPT Agronomy Protocol – Blueprint

**This repo isn’t the tool — it’s the blueprint.**

---

## 🧭 What This Is

A protocol for building schema-valid, adversarially-tested GPT instruction sets. It’s not a SaaS product. It’s not a playground. It’s a discipline.

You’ll find:

* 🔍 **The Protocol** – full design flow from raw intent to production-ready GPT logic
* 🧪 **Test Scripts** – CLI tools that simulate the pipeline
* 🧱 **Examples** – real outputs, raw and refined
* 📜 **Schema File** – the structure contract every GPT must obey

## 🧩 What You're Shipping

You’re not delivering a UI. You’re delivering a **repeatable, testable GPT engineering system**.

| Layer                         | Purpose                                            |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Instruction Alchemist         | Builds schema-valid prompts (logic enforcer)       |
| Instruction Reaper            | Brutalizes prompts to uncover weakness (validator) |
| `/examples/`                  | Proves the outputs are real and aligned            |
| `/scripts/`                   | Plug-and-play CLI test harness                     |
| `README.md`                   | Explains the system and its value                  |
| `gpt_instruction_schema.yaml` | Defines your instruction contract                  |

## 💡 Why It Matters

Most GPT builds are markdown theater — all vibes, no testability.

This protocol:

* Enforces schema structure
* Stress-tests against logical collapse
* Proves durability before deployment

It’s the difference between a clever prompt and an operational asset.

## 🛠 How to Use This Repo

1. Clone the repo
2. Inspect `gpt_instruction_schema.yaml` – this is your format contract
3. Run Alchemist CLI with a raw prompt idea → get structured output
4. Run Reaper CLI on that output → get mocked, tested, judged
5. Iterate Alchemist → Reaper until you get a pass

Use `/examples/` to guide formatting.

Use `/scripts/` as manual runners (or templates for integration).

## 👤 Who This Is For

This repo assumes you:

* Have GPT-4 access
* Prefer CLI over UI
* Want discipline and testability, not drag-and-drop toys

Ideal for:

* AI infrastructure engineers
* Ops-heavy internal AI teams
* Anyone building GPT systems that scale

---

## ✅ Final Word

You’re not here to play with prompts.
You’re here to engineer them.

This repo proves that GPT logic can be:

* Structured
* Auditable
* Break-tested

**Run the protocol. Break your own prompts. Ship stronger agents.**
